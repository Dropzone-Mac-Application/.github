## üß© Overview  

**Dropzone for macOS** is a powerful productivity utility that transforms drag-and-drop into a fast, intelligent workflow system. Whether you‚Äôre moving files, uploading to the cloud, or launching applications, Dropzone eliminates repetitive tasks and helps you get things done more efficiently.  

At its core, **Dropzone** acts as an action hub ‚Äî a customizable panel that appears when you drag files to the top of your screen. From there, you can instantly copy, move, zip, upload, or share files with a single gesture. The app integrates seamlessly with macOS, offering drag-based automation that feels both intuitive and natural.  

Users can create **custom actions** to automate everyday tasks such as sending files to AirDrop, uploading to FTP servers, or saving documents to cloud services like Google Drive or Amazon S3. Its **Drop Bar** feature also allows temporary file storage, letting you drag multiple files and group them for later use.  

Built with performance in mind, **Dropzone** runs quietly in the background and is fully optimized for **Apple Silicon**. It‚Äôs the perfect utility for power users, designers, developers, and anyone looking to simplify file management on macOS.
